# Governance

## Liberate Science GmbH

Registered as a for-profit, the company Liberate Science has shareholder(s) and director(s). 

Currently, 25,000 shares (100%) belong to Chris Hartgerink, who is also the managing director of Liberate Science. Legally, this means that all responsibilities and formal power lie with one person. We aim to counteract that with contractual obligations. 

We include [a poison pill agreement](https://www.researchequals.com/legal/poison-pill) agreement with our ResearchEquals supporting members, to ensure no shares change hands without consent (or a financial penalty paid out to the supporters).

Within the business, we operate on a consensus based principle at this time.
