## Welcome âœŠ

We work openly, and our GitHub organization is the central node of our work. Our main project is [ResearchEquals.com](https://www.researchequals.com)

Here's some helpful resources we think you will like:

- [Community event calendar](https://github.com/orgs/libscie/projects/3) - what events are on our radar and where will we be? ðŸ“†
- [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/SefsGJWWSw) - random chitchat and we could use some folk to liven up the place â›…
- [ResearchEquals knowledge base](https://docs.researchequals.com) - here we continuously expand on the use of ResearchEquals with you ðŸ™Œ

If you ðŸ’œ us - the best way to support the project is to [become a ResearchEquals supporting member](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY2aS91d3xv7rGbIJ) - it comes with perks like quarterly assemblies where you and the other supporters get to tell us what to do different or more of!
