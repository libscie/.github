## Welcome ✊

We work openly, and our GitHub organization is the central node of our work. Anybody is welcome to our GitHub organization, so [let us know with just two clicks if you want to be invited](https://github.com/libscie/.github/issues/new?title=Invitation%20to%20@libscie%20GitHub%20organization&body=I%20would%20like%20to%20request%20to%20be%20invited%20to%20the%20@libscie%20GitHub%20organization,%20thanks!)!

Our main project is [ResearchEquals.com](https://www.researchequals.com). Here's some helpful resources we think you will like:

- [Community event calendar](https://github.com/orgs/libscie/projects/3) - what events are on our radar and where will we be? 📆
- [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/SefsGJWWSw) - random chitchat and we could use some folk to liven up the place ⛅
- [ResearchEquals knowledge base](https://docs.researchequals.com) - here we continuously expand on the use of ResearchEquals with you 🙌

If you 💜 us - the best way to support the project is to [become a ResearchEquals supporting member](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY2aS91d3xv7rGbIJ) - it comes with perks like quarterly assemblies where you and the other supporters get to tell us what to do different or more of!
