# Security Policy

We do our best to keep our software secure. We recognize that this is an ongoing effort and appreciate community participation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate any reports on how we may improve our security. Please send us a (detailed) report at [security@libscie.org](mailto:security@libscie.org) at any time.

We understand it can be frustrating if you don't hear from us after sending a report. We try to respond within 48 hours on business working days. We do not have security experts on our small team, so please understand we're trying our best.

Any expertise you might share with us on how to improve any of our projects, is very welcome. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Recommendations for our reporting procedure (this document)
* General, contained improvements to the codebase (please discuss with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SefsGJWWSw))
* Discuss security with us in [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/SefsGJWWSw)
